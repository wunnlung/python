#
#Quick note, I did try my best to incorporate
#a few lines of text into graphics.py to allow
#me to rotate the text boxes, however nothing
#I tried worked. I was thinking of importing
#turtle.py through pip, but then you
#wouldn't be able to test it!
#
#what my code does is it takes a set text file,
#and turns it into a Word Cloud, with the size
#being determined by how many times one word appears
#only problem is that if too many distinct words are
#put in, the python module will get stuck in an indefinite
#while loop, and it will stop working.
#for testing purposes, I have supplied a .txt file
#of the lyrics for Twenty One Pilots House of Gold
#
#the system i used for collision to not happen is pretty
#simple. Pretty much, it generates random coordinates
#(for anywhere in the graphics window) and it runs
#and checks if the overlap with any previously accepted
#coordinates. If it doesn't overlap, then the coordinates
#are accepted, in which case it prints the new word with
#those coordinates, and adds them to a list of all the
#coordinates, so it can check again. The idea for how I
#completed this came from game design. I'm taking an
#online course on game design, and the first project was
#to recreate pong using LÃ¶ve2D. It had each paddle as it's
#own box, and it constantly checked for colision, or if
#the ball and paddle hitboxes overlapped. I had to get a
#little creative here, however, because text boxes don't
#have set windows. Instead, they are printed at a single
#point, directly in the center of the words printed. So
#therefore, I estimated the general size of words, and said
#they were 70 pixels in the x length, and 50 in the y length
#However, if i chose to do so, I can easily change those numbers
#so the words can have more space in between, or less.
#the only problem presented in this method is that there
#is an indefinite maximum words that can be put in, depending
#on what I set the borders of the hitboxes to be. If its lower,
#then more words are allowed to appear, with less space in
#between each word. If the hitboxes are bigger, then
#less words can appear. Also, because placements are
#completely random for the entire window, there isn't a
#specific amount of words that cna fit into a set size.
#for example, you can run this code with the hitboxes being
#100x and 100y, and you might get about 11 words on the screen
#before it breaks. The next time you might get 12, or 10, or
#even 13. This is because it is random, so it doesn't know
#about space efficiency. Anyway, this is a really long comment,
#and I'll let you see the code now below.

#I spent way too long on this one while loop. I'll try my best to explain the whole thing

#explain the significance later)) so 5, for loop starts. We get a random coordinate set,
#then we create a for loop for all of the coordinates that we have so far (they're in an array)
#then we check if overlap, and if it overlaps ONCE with any set of coords, we set j equal to 3,
#AND break. Break will end the for loop, so we don't redefine j, or get new coords and continue
#because j = 3, the if statement below isn't true, so therefore, it will run back through
#and create new coords to test again starting with the FIRST SET OF COORDS in the list
#however, if it can go through the entire coords list without setting off the boundary,
#then it sets j equal to 5, which SATISFIES the j!=3, which will set j equal to 1 which will
#end the while loop. I do know that you can easily simplify this, but it's working right now,
#and I don't want to touch it in case it breaks because then I will be really sad
