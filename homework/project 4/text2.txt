It's the brand new song all across the land
Do the peanut butter jelly, how you do that dance?
Put your hands to the side, ball your fists up, y'all
Watch a little shorty like this, big dawg
Ride to the style we throwin' down
And lean back all the way to the ground
Buckwheat Boyz, we in the house
So say it loud, lemme hear you shout
Now walk, walk, walk with it
Stomp, stomp, stomp with it
Slide, slide, slide with it
Bring it back one more time
Walk, walk, walk with it
Stomp, stomp, stomp with it
Slide, slide, slide with it
Peanut butter jelly, breakdown
Throw the ball up, swing that bat
Tilt your head back and see where it's at
Throw the ball up and swing that bat
Tilt your head back, lemme see where it's at
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Do the peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat
Do the peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly with a football cap
Now freestyle, freestyle your style
Freestyle, freestyle my style
Freestyle, freestyle their style
Freestyle, freestyle, buck wild
Where he at? Where he at?
Where he at? Where he at?
Now there he go, there he go
There he go, there he go
