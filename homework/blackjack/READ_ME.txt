This is Todd Shriber's and Gi CortCrasso's blackjack game! In order to run it, open the main.py file and run that. Everything else is there to help run the main function. Also really quickly before I get into the logistics of the code, for some reason only on my (Todd's) computer, the input boxes don't undraw. They flicker for a second and then just appear right again. I've ran the exact same code on Professor Chung's computer, and input boxes successfully went away, but for some reason my computer doesn't like me.

Okay, now into the logistics of the code. Pretty much, there are 4 main sections. There is the Class card, which defines what a card is, the Class Deck, which creates a deck and defines what that is, the Class blackjack, which creates the stable game, and the def main, which runs through everything else. The def main creates a blackjack game, and runs it, periodically calling sub functions from the blackjack class to help it.

A little bit about how to play the game: so you start out with 100 coins or dollars. You can enter in an amount you want to bet on that specific hand. However, you can't bet more money than you have. If you win, you win however much you bet. If you lose, you lose what you bet. However, if you get a blackjack, you get 1.5x what you bet (casino rules). If you tie, you push, and nothing happens. You can play again until you run out of funds, in which case the screen will show a "game over" sign, wait 3 seconds, and will close.

Also a fun note, my highest score right now starting from 100$ is 3360$. Let me know if you can beat it!!
