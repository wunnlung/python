This is Todd Shriber's  and Willem Henkes' project 5. For our code, we have our main function that creates the window, and calls all of the other functions. From the main function, the user has the option to either create a fractal, or solve a jumbled word. If they select the fractal, they will have the option to draw two different fractals, a tree or a c, and give it a length and recursion level. If they choose the word jumble solver, they will be able to input a jumbled word, and then the code will loop through a dictionary and output the possible words that it can make.
