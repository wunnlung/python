This save has everything from the last save included, however, some major differences. First, I added turns, so white goes, then black, then white, then black, etc. Next, I made valid moves, so knights move in l-shapes over objects, and rooks move in straight lines and can't pass over objects. I haven't added check/checkmate yet, but that will hopefully be in the next save. Also for the next save, I plan to add a function that lights up valid move squares when you select a piece, also a function that turns a pawn into a queen when it promotes. (In real chess, however, you can turn it into whatever you want, but I'm just making it a queen because in reality one person has turned it into a knight like only one time, and some people turn it into rooks for jokes.)

Update: I was unable to add a check/checkmate feature, and I tried a lot of different ways. Every single way ended up in me breaking my own code, so after about 20 total hours spent on just trying to figure it out, I give up. Instead, I'm going to add sounds for moving pieces and taking pieces!!!

Also, I was hoping that my original plan for making check and checkmate work would actually work, so I could add highlighted boxes for available moves when you select a piece. However, it didn't work, and it won't work with my current code, so yup that's where I'm at raging over this code that doesn't wanna work



Ok so because this is my final save that I think I'm going to submit, I'll give the breakdown for my code:
I started by setting the window, and coordinates. I set it to be a 10x10 coordinates graph, so when I created the grid, I could make it an 8x8 grid with 1x1 coordinate boxes. Then I made everything the right colors, and I could start making pieces. I started just by getting the images in the boxes, while being able to move them anywhere. Then I added the ability to take pieces, then I started invalid moves, by making pieces not able to take their own color. After playing around a little bit with turns going back and forth, I started to add more valid moves to each piece class. After I got that down, I then added turns going back and forth, and also a method to highlight the selected piece. I was hoping to change things up a little bit, and have the validMove be two separate functions. One that just returns all of the valid moves for the piece, and one that checks if the user inputted move is valid. Sadly, it didn't work for some reason, and I tried to do it like 3 different ways and none of them were doing what I wanted it to do. But if I got it down (which I would probably need to start over with the entire project now just to get this one thing down which I don't have time for), I would have added check / checkmate, which was originally going to be my final step, and also highlight all of the available moves for a selected piece.

As for what to submit, I think I will submit both this save, and the first save I made. The first save was just the clean board, with pieces that can move anywhere, and take anything, so it simulated a real life board. This save is sort of an incomplete version of real chess, which I'm a little sad about

Also I added satisfying clicking sounds for when the user moves a piece and takes a piece
